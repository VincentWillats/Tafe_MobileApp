                   Text="In the original 1978 Superman movie, Lois Lane names Superman after he has flown away from his interview with her using the following line of dialogue...&#10;&#10;
&quot;What a super man. Hm. 'Superman!'&quot;&#10;&#10;
2013's Man of Steel has Lois name Superman a little better. On paper, the dialogue is still pretty unsubtle
and ham-handed but the line is lifted by Amy Adams' delivery. She says the line with a hesitancy and a
little smile which shows that Lois knows this is kind of silly.&#10;&#10;
&quot;How about... Sup-&quot;&#10;&#10;
(At this point, she is interrupted.)&#10;&#10;
In &quot;Superman: The Animated Series&quot;, the cartoon Lois Lane also names Superman, except in this case it
is in a meeting with her editor after Superman's first public appearance.&#10;&#10;
&quot;He's strong. He flies. He the Nietzschean fantasy ideal all wrapped up in a red cape. The superman.&quot;
Delivery of the lines aside, how is it that a cartoon manages to produce a more intelligent, less forced,
better written, more believable and far superior origin for Superman's name than either of two Hollywood
blockbusters?&#10;&#10;
&quot;What a super man,&quot; indeed!"/>
